# Sittard Go Discord bot bootstrap
This is a wrapper around Discord JS with some
conveiniance functions to speedup bot development.
This is created to aid Pok√©mon Go groups, but can
be adapted for more general use.

Some of the helper methods are:
  - Reply; To reply directly to a message object (bot messages are ignored by default)
  - Send; Just use a channel name or id to post a message.
  - Finding admins / mods
  - Creating rich embeds
  - etc...

# Usage
To create a bot call `new SittardGoBot.Bot(config)`, where the
`config` contains all your channel and bot data. After that
you can call the `connect()` method on the returned object.

First off you might want to generate a configuration file.
To do this, just call the `Bot()` method in your file without a config.
after that run your file with the flag `-g` or `--generate` (eg. `node my_file.js -g`).
Now a config.json is created and you can edit this with your bot and guild info.

For a quick start look at the included `example.js` file or read the source to
get a full scope of the methods available.
